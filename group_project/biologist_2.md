Platform: Used open dataset LEMON (Max Planck Institute Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body Dataset), MRI data, and gamma SFC matrices. Used pyClusterROI package, but platform never specified.  

SUMMARY
Purpose: Examining the multi-scale relations and connections between human brain structure, human brain function, and the associated neurogenetics. The hypothesis is that underlying neurogenetics could help in better understanding the neurological structure and function components, as well as possible connections between structural connectivity and functional modules. Certain structural connectivities do not always correspond or give rise to the associated functional modules, and this report proposes that the underlying molecular dynamics, including neurogenetics and particular transcriptomes and proteomes, somehow influence such relationships between neuronal structure and function. 
Key Problem: One of the main issues is the lack of public repositories that integrate such data (structural and functional networks of the brain, along with the associated transcriptome profiles). In addition, many brain data repositories only consider two of three variables. It therefore uses gamma parameterized modules structural-functional and the associated neurogenetic data and code (transcriptomes and connectomes) as a sort of underlying factor and correspondence. 
Contribution: gives important insight into the relations between brain structure, function, and genetics (neurogenetics), could give insight into different types of brain disorders and pathologies, as well as the brain in general (structural and functional connectivity matrices at different resolutions, with associated neurogenetic and transcriptome profiles, especially with brain pathologies). 

RELEVANCE
Theme: Combines known data about structural and functional neuron and brain correlations with the neurogenetic and neurotranscriptome profiles to generate a comprehensive view of the brain, its different regions, and the underlying molecular and biological mechanisms.  

Lab Report #2— Benchmarking drug–drug interaction prediction methods: a perspective of distribution changes
Biologist: Leeva Selioutski

GitHub Code: https://github.com/LARS-research/DDI-Bench 
Found on: Google Scholar 
Platform:SUMMARY
Purpose: To create a robust benchmarking framework (DDI-Ben) that evaluates emerging drug–drug interaction prediction methods under realistic distribution changes, rather than relying on oversimplified i.i.d. splits.
Key Problem: Existing DDI prediction evaluations assume that known and new drugs follow the same distribution. This neglects real-world distribution changes (e.g., chemical novelty, approval timelines), leading to unreliable performance assessments of computational methods.
RELEVANCE
Theme:Introduces a distribution change simulation framework that models differences between known and new drug sets.
